My high school final project!

Based on a binary tree, I made a small app that shows probability that follows Bernoulli's law.
To see the app, just execute 'exec.py'

but obviously, as it does not use the formula, it is not very efficient (there is an exponential complexity), but it is what I wanted to prove:
I wanted to use only a binary tree, to show that Objects can handle a complex formula, but that in order to be efficient, a dev need to understand math concepts
